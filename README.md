## My AI Usage

During the development of Sugar Craft Quest, I leveraged several AI tools to enhance my development workflow and improve code quality:

### GitHub Copilot

- **Code Generation**: Used Copilot for generating boilerplate code for React components and API endpoints
- **Type Definitions**: Helped in writing TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- **CSS Styling**: Suggested Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design
- **Error Handling**: Generated error handling patterns and validation logic


### Reflection on AI Impact

Using AI tools significantly improved my development workflow in several ways:

1. **Increased Productivity**:
   - Reduced time spent on boilerplate code
   - Quick generation of repetitive patterns
   - Faster debugging and problem-solving

2. **Code Quality**:
   - More consistent error handling
   - Better type safety with TypeScript
   - Improved code organization
   - More comprehensive documentation

3. **Learning**:
   - Exposed to best practices and patterns
   - Learned new approaches to common problems
   - Better understanding of TypeScript features

4. **Challenges**:
   - Sometimes had to modify AI-generated code for specific needs
   - Needed to verify and test generated code thoroughly
   - Had to ensure consistency across AI suggestions

The combination of GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT proved invaluable in building a robust application while maintaining high code quality and following best practices.
